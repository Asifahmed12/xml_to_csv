# xml_to_csv
This code will help in combining multiple xml to single csv

In my professional experience, I came across a situation where the client send us the data in XML format and we have to analyze that data.
Since analysis is preferred to be done on a tabluar format data - by me ofcourse :-)

So this is the code which I created to change multiple xml files in a location to single csv.

Please go through the code, in case of any issue comment below.
